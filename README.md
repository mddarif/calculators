# 🖐️ Virtual Gesture Calculator
### Touchless Calculator Using Computer Vision & Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Virtual Gesture Calculator** is a computer vision–based application that allows users to perform mathematical calculations without touching any physical device.  
It uses **hand gesture recognition** to enable air-typing on a virtual calculator interface, demonstrating modern **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**.
